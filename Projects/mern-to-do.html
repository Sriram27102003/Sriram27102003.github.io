      <h1>To-Do-List using MERN Stack</h1>
      
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>Organizes Tasks: Stores tasks persistently using MongoDB.

Enforces Deadlines: Uses Due Dates for prioritization and structure.

Ensures Timeliness: Uses Reminders (managed by Node/Express) to proactively alert the user and prevent missed deadlines.

Delivers a Decent UX: Provides a fast, interactive experience via React.</p>
      
      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <p>
        1. 💾 Backend (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js)
The backend handles data persistence, core logic, and the critical scheduling of reminders.

Data Model (MongoDB): The task schema must include fields for:

title (String)

description (String)

dueDate (Date type)

reminderTime (Date type, e.g., 30 minutes before the dueDate).

isCompleted (Boolean)

API Endpoints (Express.js): Standard RESTful APIs are used for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

POST /api/tasks: Create a new task, including the dueDate and reminderTime.

GET /api/tasks: Retrieve all tasks.

PUT /api/tasks/:id: Update task details or completion status.

Reminder Scheduling (Node.js): This is the most technical part.

Use a library like node-cron or Agenda to set up a scheduled job that runs periodically (e.g., every minute).

This job queries MongoDB for tasks where the reminderTime is within the next few minutes and the task is not yet completed.

For matched tasks, the backend triggers the reminder notification logic (see point 3).

2. 🖥️ Frontend (React)
The React frontend focuses on collecting task data and displaying the reminder pop-ups.

Task Input: Use form components where the user can select a task title and, crucially, a date and time picker for the dueDate and optionally set the reminderTime.

State Management: Use React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect) or a global state library (Redux/Zustand) to manage the list of tasks and the state of any visible reminders.

API Interaction: Use fetch or a library like Axios to communicate with the Express backend endpoints for creating, fetching, and updating tasks.

      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <p>MongoDB,Express.js,React.js,Node.js</p>
      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The combination of the MERN stack with these features results in a fully functional, interactive, and reliable application whose purpose is to help the user stop forgetting things and manage their time effectively.
